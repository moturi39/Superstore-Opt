Superstore Profitability Analysis Project 

Project Overview
This project analyzed a Superstore's sales and profitability data to optimize performance across different segments and regions.

Key Findings
1. . Sales-Profit Relationships
Moderate Correlation: Sales and profits showed a 0.48 correlation
- Non-linear Pattern: Relationship between sales and profits isn't strictly linear
- Outliers: Identified cases of high sales with unexpectedly low profits

2. Discount Impact Analysis
Negative Effect: -0.15 correlation between discounts and profit
- Limited Benefits: Discounts showed minimal impact on increasing sales volume
- Efficiency Concerns: Current discount strategy may be reducing profitability

3. Quantity-Sales Analysis
- Weak Correlation: Only 0.20 correlation between quantity and sales
- Pricing Variations: Suggests inconsistent pricing strategies
- Volume Impact: Higher quantities don't guarantee proportional sales increase

Model Performance 
(a) Linear Regression Results
MAE: 0.29
R² Score: -0.81
Poor performance indicates complex relationships

(b)Random Forest Results
MAE: 0.19
R² Score: -0.29
Better performance but still shows limitations

Recommendations
1. Discount Strategy Revision
- Review and optimize discount policies
- Target discounts to specific segments
- Monitor profit margins closely


2. Sales Strategy
- Focus on high-margin products
